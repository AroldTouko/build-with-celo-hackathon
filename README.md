CELO HACKATHON PROJECT 

RINGNANCE (PRONOUNCED "RING NANCE", A CIRCULAR “LIKE A RING” FINANCE SYSTEM FOR PROJECT FUNDING AND MONEY SAVING.)


CONTEXT : 

The project that we propose first consists  in automating and increasing the reliability of a tontine system thanks to the Blockchain. 
I live in a community where an activity called “tontine” is frequently practiced. This activity takes place in families, villages, companies, etc. 
Its principle is as follows: a group of people (who frequently know each other) wishing either to save or to launch an income-generating activity 
meet and decide to contribute at very specific time intervals a sum of money, the total of which will be given to the beneficiary of the period. 
The order in which one benefits is fixed at the beginning of the tontine by unanimity between the members. To make it clearer, let's take for 
example a tontine of $500, with 10 participants (Franck, Dumas, Ezekiel, Olga, Jessie, Alfred, Bertrand, Hermann, Martha and Minerva) who decided
to contribute this amount each week. At unanimity, they decide to benefit in this order:

First week: Hermann

Second week: Jessie

Third week: Ezekiel

Fourth week: Martha

Fifth week: Alfred

Sixth week: Bertrand

Seventh week: Minerva

Eighth week: Franck

Ninth week: Olga

Tenth week: Dumas 

In this case, each week the beneficiary will benefit from 500 x 10 = $5,000. 

We therefore understand the usefulness of this system for those who have a project and want to have enough funds to finance it immediately 
(they usually benefit first. In this case we have: Herman, Jessie, Ezekiel, etc.) and use the dividends to repay during the other tontine periods; 
and also, for those who do not need money immediately (they usually benefit at the end. In this case we have: Olga, Franck, etc.) and use tontines 
as a way of savings not monitored by the banks and government and therefore difficult to tax. For those who don’t have enough money but want to lunch
an income generating activity which can make enough money to contribute every month, they have to integrate the tontine by a way of a guarantor who
take full responsibility to contribute each month their parrainee don’t.

WEAKNESSES:
 
The weakness of such a system is the need for a third party, usually a treasurer whom everyone “trusts” and who receive all the members contribution. 
It is up to the latter to monitor the evolution of the contributions and pay the final amount to the beneficiary for the current period. This is a weakness
because the individual in question does not receive all the contributions the same day. Receiving these in a deferred way, he can face an emergency to spend
this money, putting in harm all the members of the tontine. He can also claim to have been assaulted and appeal to the good hearts of the members not to hold
it against him. For a fairly high contribution amount (a total of $100, 000 per month for example), the treasurer taken by the lure of gain can take to their heels,
pocketing the contribution for a period with him. These are the problems that members of a tontine often face. 

OUR SOLUTION:

The tontine is underrated because considered as a traditional system. Thanks to blockchain, we will make it at his true value by offering the possibility to have worldwide tontine.
Contributions can be made more reliable by making them through a low-fee stable coin in which everyone trusts and can accept it against fiat currencies: like Celo USD; 
and by setting up a platform on which, once a tontine has been created with its various parameters (name of the tontine’s members, contribution amount, contribution space
and food(1) order), members will be able to contribute by just clicking on a button. The funds will be saved by a smart contract who will therefore, after everyone has contributed,
automatically transfer the food(1) to the beneficiary for a specified period. The reliability of the smart contracts and the security of the Blockchain will ensure the integrity 
of the data, the traceability of the transactions carried out by the members and the reception assured to the beneficiary of his food.  


TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICITIES : 

-	We will build during this a community oriented web3 platform to fund project or save money. It will give the possibility to those who don't have enough fund or for community
    in poverty to access fund to launch an income generating activity and periodically return the "rotative money" in simplified way such as USSD/SMS.
	
-	One advantage will be the opportunity to do the rotative money activity using trustable and low fee stable coin like Celo USD and make the onramp and offramp also possible with
    many fiat currencies to do deposit or withdrawal.
